This network learns to localize camera pose. It uses transfer learning with Inception-Resnet-V2 to account for small datasets. Basically, after training, it can localize fairly well in the region the training photos were taken in.
So, after training it can say an input image is at (x, y, z) coordinates and an angle a relative to some arbitrary reference frame which is defined during training.
